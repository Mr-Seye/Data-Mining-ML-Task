# 📊 Data Mining and Machine Learning Project

A modular, task-driven Jupyter notebook demonstrating key stages of the machine learning pipeline, including pre-processing, supervised and unsupervised learning, and statistical testing. The project uses a dataset derived from the EuroSAT dataset and is structured for learning and experimentation with adjustable hyperparameters.

1. **Pre-processing and Transformation**  
2. **Classification and Regression**  
3. **Hypothesis Testing**  
4. **Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction**

Each section includes:
- A topic title
- Markdown-formatted question and reflective response
- Code cells to perform the task using adjustable hyperparameters

## 🚀 Usage

### Adjustable Hyperparameters

Each task allows parameter tuning for experimentation:

#### **Task 1 – Pre-processing**
- Feature count

#### **Task 2 – Classification/Regression**
- Layer sizes (MLP)
- Iteration count
- Random seed
- Learning rate
- Classifier type (`svc`, `mlp`)
- Cross-validation folds

#### **Task 3 – Hypothesis Testing**
- Significance threshold (`alpha`)
- Cross-validation and statistical test comparisons

#### **Task 4 – Clustering**
- PCA component count
- Number of clusters (`k`)
- Clustering iterations
- Clustering random seed
